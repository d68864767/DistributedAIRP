# User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the Distributed AI Research Platform (DAIRP). This platform is designed to facilitate collaborative AI development and research across distributed systems, with a focus on privacy-preserving machine learning and large-scale data processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run DAIRP, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and MongoDB from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/distributed-ai-research-platform.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd distributed-ai-research-platform`.
3. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.

### Configuration

Before you can run the platform, you need to set up your environment variables. These are stored in the `.env` file. Here's what each variable means:

- `DB_HOST`: The host of your MongoDB database.
- `DB_USER`: The username for your MongoDB database.
- `DB_PASS`: The password for your MongoDB database.
- `DB_NAME`: The name of your MongoDB database.
- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
- `NODE_MANAGER_URL`: The URL of the node manager in your distributed system.
- `TASK_DISTRIBUTOR_URL`: The URL of the task distributor in your distributed system.
- `PRIVACY_PRESERVING_MODEL_PATH`: The path to your privacy-preserving AI model.
- `DATA_ANALYSIS_MODEL_PATH`: The path to your data analysis model.

### Running the Platform

Once you've set up your environment variables, you can run the platform using `npm start`.

## Using the Platform

### API Endpoints

The platform provides several API endpoints for managing datasets and projects. You can find detailed documentation for these endpoints in the `API_Docs.md` file.

### Distributed System

The platform is designed to work with a distributed system. You can manage the nodes in your system using the `nodeManager.js` file and distribute tasks across these nodes using the `taskDistributor.js` file.

### AI Models

The platform supports privacy-preserving machine learning and large-scale data processing. You can manage your AI models using the `privacyPreservingModel.js` and `dataAnalysisModel.js` files.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the platform, please refer to the `Technical_Overview.md` file for a detailed explanation of how the platform works. If you're still having trouble, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.

## Conclusion

Thank you for choosing DAIRP for your AI research needs. We hope you find it useful and look forward to seeing what you'll create with it.
